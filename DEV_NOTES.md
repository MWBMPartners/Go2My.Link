# GoToMyLink — Developer Notes

> Working notes, decisions, gotchas, and tips for the development team.

## 🖥️ Environment

- **Primary OS:** macOS (Windows occasionally)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code with FTP Sync extension
- **🚢 Hosting:** Dreamhost Shared Hosting
  - ❌ No CLI access (no Composer, no npm, no artisan)
  - 📦 Libraries must be manually downloaded and uploaded
  - 🌐 CDN-first with local fallback pattern for all third-party libraries
- **🖥️ PHP Version:** 8.5+ (with 8.4 backward compatibility via `version_compare()`)
- **🗄️ MySQL Version:** 8.0+

## 🏗️ Key Architecture Decisions

### ❌ No Composer

Dreamhost shared hosting doesn't provide CLI access. All third-party PHP libraries must be:

1. 📥 Downloaded manually
2. 📁 Placed in `web/_libraries/` (server-wide) or `web/{component}/_libraries/` (component-specific)
3. 📋 Included via `require_once` with existence checks

### 🗄️ MySQLi Only

PDO is not used. All database interactions go through MySQLi with prepared statements exclusively.
This is both a project requirement and a security measure against SQL injection.

### ⚙️ Settings in Database

All configuration (except DB connection credentials) is stored in `tblSettings` with a scope
hierarchy: User > Organisation > System > Default (from `tblSettingsDictionary`).

🔒 Sensitive settings are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using the SALT from `auth_creds.php`.

### 🔀 Clean URLs

No `.php` extensions visible to users. Achieved via:

- ⚙️ `.htaccess` RewriteRules (primary method)
- 📁 Directory-based routing (`/something/index.php` serves `/something`)

### 🐛 Error Handling Strategy

- 🔴 PHP errors → `tblErrorLog` (severity, code, title, detail, backtrace, request URL, headers)
- 📊 Activity logging → `tblActivityLog` (all request data, IP, UA, geo)
- 🐛 Debug mode → `?debug=true` URL parameter (restricted to admin/allowed IPs)
- 👤 User-facing errors → Graceful branded error pages

### 📡 QR Codes — External Service

> ⚠️ **Important:** QR code functionality is NOT part of this project. It will be a separate first-party service.

The `hasQRCodes` column in `tblSubscriptionTiers` is retained as a feature flag for future
integration with that external service.

### ⚙️ Admin Dashboard Subdomain

The admin dashboard (user dashboard, link management, settings) is served from
`web/Go2My.Link/_admin/public_html/` at `admin.go2my.link`. This is part of Component A
but separated from the public-facing website.

## 💡 Gotchas & Tips

### ⚠️ PHP 8.5 vs 8.4

Use `version_compare(PHP_VERSION, '8.5.0', '>=')` for features only available in 8.5.
Always provide a fallback for 8.4 compatibility.

### 🔑 Auth Credentials

The `auth_creds.php` files use `if (!defined('CONSTANT'))` guards. Per-component files
can override server-wide values by defining constants BEFORE including the server-wide file.

> 💡 **Tip:** Define component-specific constants BEFORE the `require_once` for the server-wide `auth_creds.php`.

### ⚙️ .htaccess

Each component's `public_html/` needs its own `.htaccess` for URL routing.
Dreamhost respects `.htaccess` files with `AllowOverride All`.

## 📏 Coding Standards Quick Reference

- ✅ Full `if/else` blocks (no shorthand)
- 📝 Detailed inline comments with official documentation links
- 🖥️ Use PHP predefined constants (`DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR`, `PHP_EOL`, etc.)
- 🌍 All UI strings use `__('key')` translation function
- ♿ All form fields have associated `<label>` elements (WCAG)
- 😊 Emojis are OK in code comments
