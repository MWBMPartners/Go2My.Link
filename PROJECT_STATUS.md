## 🔄 In Progress

### v1.1.0 — 📡 API & Analytics (Phase 7) — Early Work

Cross-cutting infrastructure improvements completed ahead of main Phase 7 API work:

#### 📧 Email System Modernization (#88) ✅

- [x] Multipart MIME rewrite: text/plain + text/x-amp-html + text/html (RFC 2046)
- [x] HTML-to-plaintext converter (`g2ml_htmlToPlainText()`)
- [x] AMP for Email templates (8 templates in `email_templates/amp/`)
- [x] Dark mode CSS in all 7 HTML email templates
- [x] Preheader text support in all templates
- [x] Modern headers: List-Unsubscribe, X-Entity-Ref-ID, Precedence, Auto-Submitted
- [x] New settings seed: `012_email_settings.sql` (7 settings)

#### 🚨 Mass Credential Reset / Breach Response (#89) ✅

- [x] `breach_response.php` with 6 functions (invalidate passwords, revoke sessions, batch emails, salt rotation)
- [x] Admin page at `/security/breach-response` (GlobalAdmin only)
- [x] `forcePasswordReset` wired into `loginUser()` → session-based token redirect
- [x] Breach notification email template (HTML + AMP)
- [x] ENCRYPTION_SALT rotation with transaction wrapping
- [x] Audit logging to dedicated log file (UTC timestamps)

#### 🔒 Security Hardening (#79–#87) ✅

- [x] CRLF header injection prevention in email system (recipient, subject, DB-sourced values, extra headers)
- [x] Path traversal prevention via template name regex validation
- [x] Transaction wrapping for salt rotation (prevents irrecoverable mixed-key state)
- [x] TOCTOU race condition fix (cooldown timestamp set at start)
- [x] Session-based forced reset token transport (prevents URL/Referer leakage)
- [x] Control character sanitisation, memory clearing, UTC timestamps
- [x] Error suppression removal, input bounds validation, double-encoding fix

#### 🔧 CI/CD Fix (#76) ✅

- [x] PHP Lint workflow: `php-parallel-lint` → `parallel-lint` binary name fix

#### 🎨 Branding & Landing Pages ✅

- [x] SVG + PNG logo integration in navbar (`nav.php`) and footer (`footer.php`) via `<picture>` element
- [x] Web-accessible logos deployed to `/img/logo.svg` + `/img/logo.png` in all 4 component `public_html/` dirs
- [x] Full BrandKit assets deployed to `web/assets/BrandKit/` (logos, icons, favicons, PWA icons, press kit, docs)
- [x] Landing pages converted from `.html` to `.php` with logo integration
- [x] Auto-refresh (15 min) + SVG countdown ring indicator (hidden on mobile, synced to meta tag)
- [x] Footer pinned to bottom, main content vertically centred
- [x] Dark mode + reduced motion support on all landing pages
- [x] Dynamic favicon PNG detection in `header.php` via `file_exists()`

## ✅ Completed (Previous Phases)

### 🏷️ Infrastructure: Multi-Account-Type Support ✅

Cross-phase infrastructure improvement — enables users to hold multiple account types simultaneously:

- [x] Database schema: `tblAccountTypes` reference table + `tblUserAccountTypes` junction table (`015_account_types.sql`)
- [x] Seed data: 4 system account types matching legacy ENUM roles (`011_account_types.sql`)
- [x] Migration: Backfill junction table from existing `tblUsers.role` (`008_migrate_account_types.sql`)
- [x] PHP library: `account_types.php` with 9 functions (assign, revoke, sync, query)
- [x] Auth integration: session loading, getCurrentUser(), registerUser()
- [x] Org integration: createOrg, acceptInvitation, changeMemberRole, removeMember
- [x] Admin UI: members page multi-type badges, profile page type display
- [x] JSON schemas: `account-type.schema.json`, `user-account-type.schema.json`

## ❌ Current Blockers

None. _(Historical, 2026-02-24 — superseded. As of 2026-07-19 the remaining pre-launch
items are owner-blocked, not dev blockers: #93 DB-credential rotation, DB cutover
[migrations 016 + 019 mandatory], legal sign-off on 5 legal documents, and SIGNula/billing
credentials. See HANDOFF.md.)_

## 📝 Recent Decisions

- 🔑 **Token storage** — All tokens (session, email verify, password reset) stored as SHA-256 hashes in DB; plaintext only in `$_SESSION` or email links
- 🔒 **Cross-subdomain sessions** — Cookie domain `.go2my.link` in production for sharing between go2my.link and admin.go2my.link
- 🛡️ **Email enumeration prevention** — Generic errors on registration, login, and forgot-password; timing-safe dummy hash on user-not-found
- 🔐 **Account lockout** — After 5 failed login attempts, account locked for 15 minutes (configurable via settings)
- 🎨 **Dark/light mode** required for all web UI — manual toggle + automatic system preference detection (Bootstrap 5.3 `data-bs-theme`)
- 📋 **Phase restructuring (Feb 2026)** — Merged old Phases 3+4 into new Phase 3; split old Phase 5 into Phases 4+5
- 📋 **Phase restructuring (Feb 2026)** — Prioritised org management (Phase 5) + compliance (Phase 6, was Phase 10) before pre-release; advanced auth, API, LinksPage, advanced redirects, payments become post-launch Phases 7-11
- 🚀 **Pre-release marker** — v1.0.0-rc after Phase 6 (compliance); sufficient for minimum launchable product
- 📊 **Code quality baseline** — PHP lint (60 files clean), JSON Schemas (5 schema files + validator), W3C compliance verified, CI enhanced with PHPStan + PHPCS
- 🔍 **JSON Schema validation** — All JSON structures have matching schemas in `web/_schemas/`; pure-PHP validator `g2ml_validateJSON()` for Dreamhost
- ♿ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) is a foundational requirement from Phase 2 onwards
- 🌍 i18n infrastructure built into Phase 2; formal translations in Phase 6
- 🌍 Interim Google/Bing/AI translation widget until formal translations are ready
- 🎨 Branding/logo design included in Phase 0
- 🔒 All passwords from existing database will be force-reset during migration (currently plaintext)
- 🗑️ `tblLicenses` (legacy NetPLAYER data) will NOT be migrated
- 📁 Branding directory is `assets/BrandKit/` (moved from `.BrandKit/`)
- 🗄️ New database uses InnoDB (replacing MyISAM) with proper FK constraints
- ⚙️ Settings merged into single table with scope hierarchy (Default > System > Organisation > User)
- 📊 Activity log migrated with batch approach (10K rows per batch) due to volume
- 🔗 QR codes excluded from project — will be a separate first-party service with future integration
- 📁 Component A directory renamed from `GoToMy.Link` to `Go2My.Link` (domain name match)
- 🏢 Admin dashboard separated to `admin.go2my.link` subdomain (`_admin/public_html/`)
- 🚀 **Release workflow** — GitHub Actions `release.yml` supports per-component releases (A, B, C, Admin, All) with PHP lint, tagging, and auto-generated release notes
- 📡 **OpenAPI/Swagger docs** — Issue #75 added to Phase 6 for interactive API documentation at `/api/docs`
- 🏷️ **Product rename** — Corrected from "GoToMyLink" to "Go2My.Link" across all files, repo, and project board
- 📋 **Issue templates** — Added Bug Report, Feature Request, Phase Task forms + PR template

## 🔜 Next Up

**#91 Custom domain integration** — Finalise client custom domain setup flow. Database schema and admin UI exist (Phase 5), but needs: redirect engine integration for `tblOrgDomains` (type: redirect), DNS verification automation, domain validation improvements (IDN/punycode, reserved list), client setup documentation (`docs/CUSTOM_DOMAINS.md`), in-app setup wizard with provider-specific DNS instructions, and REST API endpoints (ties into #38/#39).

**Phase 7 remaining work** — REST API endpoints, OpenAPI/Swagger docs (#75), API key auth, analytics dashboard, click tracking, geographic maps, device breakdown, data export.

**#71 Translations** — en-GB baseline seeded with ~1,075 keys. The 9 additional locales deferred to post-launch. Interim Google Translate widget covers machine translation.

**Post-launch suggestions** (non-blocking):

- 🔒 Nonce-based CSP to replace `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts (requires server-side nonce generation)
- 🔒 Replace `confirm()` dialogs with Bootstrap modals for better UX/accessibility
- 🔒 Session cleanup probability tuning (currently 1/100, review under production load)
- ⚖️ Professional legal review of all 5 legal documents (`{{LEGAL_REVIEW_NEEDED}}` placeholders)

**Future phases:** Phase 8 (LinksPage), Phase 9 (Advanced Redirects), Phase 10 (Advanced Auth via SIGNula), Phase 11 (Payments via SIGNula).
